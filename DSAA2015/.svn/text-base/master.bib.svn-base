  Abstract                 = {Soccer is the most popular sport worldwide. Over time, the importance of soccer has grown beyond the sports domain, making it a large industry, a source of national pride, and the center of public attention in most countries. Due to this increased significance, it is highly important for soccer teams at both the club and national levels to invest in sciences providing a competitive edge over opponents. Quantitative analysis of soccer is one of the domains that have enjoyed a sharp growth in the recent years. Using the advanced data collection and analysis tools, it has become possible to implement more sophisticated performance analysis methodologies. In this study, a model has been developed to anticipate the collective team performance based on the attributes of the individual players. The model is then used to predict how the hiring of new players affects team performance. The data used for this study has been collected from the English Premier League between the 2008/09 and 2011/2012 seasons. Using the model, team performance can be predicted with an average error of 7.857 units of goal differential. Also, the effect of a new player on team performance can be predicted with an average error of 18.912 units of goal differential. Using a classification strategy, the model was able to correctly predict the direction of change in team performance caused by a new player 85.6% of the time. This provides a minimum of 20% increase in accuracy compared to the current transfer success rate at the highest level of club soccer. Therefore, using this model is expected to save clubs large amounts of money while enhancing performance.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper analyzes a unique data set consisting of all penalty calls in the National Hockey League between the 1995¨C1996 and 2001¨C2002 seasons. The primary finding is the prevalence of ¡°reverse calls:¡± if previous penalties have been on one team, then the next penalty is more likely to be on the other. This pattern is consistent with a simple behavioral rationale based on the fundamental difficulty of refereeing a National Hockey League game. Statistical modeling reveals that the identity of the next team to be penalized also depends on a variety of other factors, including the score, the time in the game, the time since last penalty, which team is at home, and whether one or two referees are calling the game. There is also evidence of differences among referees in their tendency to reverse calls.},

  Abstract                 = {While standard procedures of causal reasoning as procedures analyzing causal {B}ayesian networks are custom-built for (non-deterministic) probabilistic structures, this paper introduces a Boolean procedure that uncovers deterministic causal structures. Contrary to existing Boolean methodologies, the procedure advanced here successfully analyzes structures of arbitrary complexity. It roughly involves three parts: first, deterministic dependencies are identified in the data; second, these dependencies are suitably minimalized in order to eliminate redundancies; and third, one or{\textemdash}in case of ambiguities{\textemdash}more than one causal structure is assigned to the minimalized deterministic dependencies.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we present a new algorithm for searching trees. The algorithm, which we have named B*, finds a proof that an arc at the root of a search tree is better than any other. It does this by attempting to find both the best arc at the root and the simplest proof, in best-first fashion. This strategy determines the order of node expansion. Any node that is expanded is assigned two values: an upper (or optimistic) bound and a lower (or pessimistic) bound. During the course of a search, these bounds at a node tend to converge, producing natural termination of the search. As long as all nodal bounds in a sub-tree are valid, B??¡ª will select the best arc at the root of that sub-tree. We present experimental and analytic evidence that B??¡ª is much more effective than present methods of searching adversary trees. The B??¡ª method assigns a greater responsibility for guiding the search to the evaluation functions that compute the bounds than has been done before. In this way knowledge, rather than a set of arbitrary predefined limits can be used to terminate the search itself. It is interesting to note that the evaluation functions may measure any properties of the domain, thus resulting in selecting the arc that leads to the greatest quantity of whatever is being measured. We conjecture that this method is that used by chess masters in analyzing chess trees.},

  Abstract                 = {Using NHL data for the 1997¨C1998 through 2011¨C2012 seasons, we examine the effect of age on scoring performance and plus-minus for NHL skaters (non-goalies) and on save percentage for goaltenders. We emphasize fixed-effects regression methods that estimate a representative age-performance trajectory. We also use a method based on the best performances over time, a method based on the age distribution of NHL players, and a ¡°na?ve¡± specification that does not correct for selection bias. In addition we estimate individual age-performance relationships to obtain a distribution of peak ages. All methods provide similar results (with small but understandable differences) except the na?ve specification, which yields implausible results, indicating that correcting for selection bias is very important. Our best estimate of the scoring peak age is between 27 and 28 for forwards and between 28 and 29 for defencemen. Both forwards and defencemen exhibit near-peak performance over a wide range, going from about 24 to 32 and 24 to 34, respectively. Goaltenders display little systematic performance variation over most of the age range from the early 20s to late 30s.},

  Abstract                 = {Computer-intensive algorithms, such as the Gibbs sampler, have become increasingly popular statistical tools, both in applied and theoretical work. The properties of such algorithms, however, may sometimes not be obvious. Here we give a simple explanation of how and why the Gibbs sampler works. We analytically establish its properties in a simple case and provide insight for more complicated cases. There are also a number of examples.},

  Abstract                 = {Pointwise consistent, feasible procedures for estimating contemporaneous linear causal structure from time series data have been developed using multiple conditional independence tests, but no such procedures are available for non-linear systems. We describe a feasible procedure for learning a class of non-linear time series structures, which we call additive non-linear time series. We show that for data generated from stationary models of this type, two classes of conditional independence relations among time series variables and their lags can be tested efficiently and consistently using tests based on additive model regression. Combining results of statistical tests for these two classes of conditional independence relations and the temporal structure of time series data, a new consistent model specification procedure is able to extract relatively detailed causal information. We investigate the finite sample behavior of the procedure through simulation, and illustrate the application of this method through analysis of the possible causal connections among four ocean indices. Several variants of the procedure are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {This study was designed to examine both the pattern of team and player efficacy across a season of competition and the relationships among player efficacy, team efficacy, and team performance in collegiate ice hockey. The team and player efficacies of hockey players from 6 teams in a midwestern collegiate hockey league were assessed prior to 32 games. Official game statistics were factor analyzed to produce one useable performance measure, performance outcome. A consensus analysis demonstrated that players held homogeneous beliefs regarding their own and their teams' abilities to perform successfully. A meta-analysis of the regression equations for each team confirmed the homogeneity among teams and the predictive superiority of team efficacy in predicting team performance. Also, when team wins and losses were analyzed across the season, team efficacy significantly increased after a win and significantly decreased after a loss, but player efficacy was not affected.},

  Abstract                 = {Logical {B}ayesian Networks {(LBNs)} have recently been introduced as another language for knowledge based model construction of {B}ayesian networks, besides existing languages such as Probabilistic Relational Models {(PRMs)} and {B}ayesian Logic Programs {(BLPs).} The original description of {LBNs} introduces them as a variant of {BLPs} and discusses the differences with {BLPs} but still leaves room for a deeper discussion of the relationship between {LBNs} and {BLPs.} Also the relationship to {PRMs} was not treated in much detail. In this paper, we first give a more compact and clear definition of {LBNs.} Next, we describe in more detail how {PRMs} and {BLPs} relate to {LBNs.} Like this we not only see what the advantages and disadvantages of {LBNs} are with respect to {PRMs} and {BLPs,} we also gain more insight into the relationships between {PRMs} and {BLPs.} Keywords: Probabilistic-logical models, {B}ayesian networks, knowledge representation, {B}ayesian Logic Programs, Probabilistic Relational Models.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Temporal Nodes Bayesian Networks (TNBNs) are an alternative to Dynamic Bayesian Networks for temporal reasoning with much simpler and efficient models in some domains. \{TNBNs\} are composed of temporal nodes, temporal intervals, and probabilistic dependencies. However, methods for learning this type of models from data have not yet been developed. In this paper, we propose a learning algorithm to obtain the structure and temporal intervals for \{TNBNs\} from data. The method consists of three phases: (i) obtain an initial approximation of the intervals, (ii) obtain a structure using a standard algorithm and (iii) refine the intervals for each temporal node based on a clustering algorithm. We evaluated the method with synthetic data from three different \{TNBNs\} of different sizes. Our method obtains the best score using a combined measure of interval quality and prediction accuracy, and a competitive structural quality with lower running times, compared to other related algorithms. We also present a real world application of the algorithm with data obtained from a combined cycle power plant in order to diagnose temporal faults.},

  Abstract                 = {Ice hockey is relatively under computationally analyzed. Possibly this is because ice hockey is a continuous flow game with relatively few major events (goal scoring) while most of the other games that have been data mined can be described as being a series of clearly bounded events. This work describes needs of data mining ice hockey statistics to quantify the contribution of individual hockey players to team success. Large databases of ice hockey statistics for the collegiate and professional levels can be accessed to perform this work. The goal is to use ice hockey statistics and computational methods to help make personnel decisions at both the coaching and franchise management levels. This type of work has the potential to encourage new avenues of sports statistics research, as well as statistical research and data mining, in general.},

A category specific cost model is proposed and several effective methods of training a cost sensitive filter are studied, using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the base classifier. Clear benefits of explictly accounting for varied misclassification costs, either during training or as a form of post-processing, are shown.},

  Abstract                 = {In real world applications, graphical statistical models are not only a tool for operations such as classification or prediction, but usually the network structures of the models themselves are also of great interest (e.g., in modeling brain connectivity). The false discovery rate {(FDR),} the expected ratio of falsely claimed connections to all those claimed, is often a reasonable error-rate criterion in these applications. However, current learning algorithms for graphical models have not been adequately adapted to the concerns of the {FDR.} The traditional practice of controlling the type I error rate and the type {II} error rate under a conventional level does not necessarily keep the {FDR} low, especially in the case of sparse networks. In this paper, we propose embedding an {FDR-control} procedure into the {PC} algorithm to curb the {FDR} of the skeleton of the learned graph. We prove that the proposed method can control the {FDR} under a user-specified level at the limit of large sample sizes. In the cases of moderate sample size (about several hundred), empirical experiments show that the method is still able to control the {FDR} under the user-specified level, and a heuristic modification of the method is able to control the {FDR} more accurately around the user-specified level. The proposed method is applicable to any models for which statistical tests of conditional independence are available, such as discrete models and Gaussian models.},

  Abstract                 = {In current constraint-based {(Pearl-style)} systems for discovering {B}ayesian networks, inputs with deterministic relations are prohibited. This restricts the applicability of these systems. In this paper, we formalize a sufficient condition under which {B}ayesian networks can be recovered even with deterministic relations. The sufficient condition leads to an improvement to Pearl{\textquoteright}s {IC} algorithm; other constraint-based algorithms can be similarly improved. The new algorithm, assuming the sufficient condition proposed, is able to recover {B}ayesian networks with deterministic relations, and moreover suffers no loss of performance when applied to nondeterministic {B}ayesian networks.},

  Abstract                 = {One difficulty with analyzing performance in hockey is the relatively low scor- ing rates compared to sports like basketball. Fenwick rating (shots plus missed shots) and Corsi rating (shots, missed shots, blocked shots) have been used to an- alyze players and teams because they have been shown to be better than goals as a predictor of future goals. In this paper, we use variables like faceoffs, hits, and other statistics as predictor variables in addition to goals, shots, missed shots, and blocked shots, to predict goals. Our models outperform previous models with regard to mean squared error of actual goals and predicted goals. The results can be interpreted as expected goals and can be used in adjusted plus-minus models instead of goals. We use ridge regression to estimate a player¡¯s contribution to his team¡¯s expected goals per 60 minutes, independent of his teammates, opponents, and the zone in which his shifts begin. We also give adjusted plus-minus estimates based on goals, shots, Fenwick rating, and Corsi rating and use these results along- side the results for expected goals to provide an additional means by which NHL analysts, decision-makers, and fans can measure how valuable a player is to his team.},

  Abstract                 = {The plus-minus statistic for NHL players is meant to be a measure of a player's offensive and defensive abilities. However, a player's plus-minus is highly dependent on the team he plays for, the opponents he faces, and other variables out of his control, so it is not always a good measure of that player's individual contribution to his team. In this paper we develop an adjusted plus-minus statistic that attempts to isolate a player's individual contribution. Using data from the detailed shift reports on NHL.com, we develop two weighted least squares regression models to estimate an NHL player's effect on his team's success in scoring and preventing goals, independent of that player's teammates and opponents. Our initial work focused on even strength situations, excluding situations in which one team had pulled their goalie. In our current work, we have modeled power play and shorthanded situations, and we are able to estimate a player's offensive and defensive contributions during those situations. Also, for those shifts that begin with a faceoff, we have accounted for the zone on the ice in which a shift begins.},

  Abstract                 = {Modeling and prediction of ice hockey match results are not as widely examined areas as modeling and prediction of association football match results. It is assumed that match results in football and ice hockey can be modeled by the bivariate Poisson distribution or by some modification of this distribution. The aim of this paper is to explore the possibility of using models derived for football match results also for ice hockey match results and to propose some modifications of these models. A new model based on alternative definition of the bivariate Poisson distribution is presented. The models are tested on historical data from the highest-level ice hockey league in the Czech Republic between the years 1999 and 2012.},

  Abstract                 = {This study examined reciprocal relationships between collective efficacy and team performance over a season of competition in women's intercollegiate ice hockey within weekends where the opponent was constant for 2 games. Collective efficacy beliefs within 12 teams were assessed prior to both games for at least 7 weekends. Team performance indexes produced an overall measure of performance for each game. The average influence of Saturday collective efficacy on Saturday performance was moderate and positive after controlling for Friday performance. The average influence of Friday performance on Saturday collective efficacy was small and positive after removing the influence of Friday collective efficacy from Friday performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Inductive Logic Programming is a young and rapidly growing field combining machine learning and logic programming. This self-contained tutorial is the first theoretical introduction to ILP; it provides the reader with a rigorous and sufficiently broad basis for future research in the area. In the first part, a thorough treatment of first-order logic, resolution-based theorem proving, and logic programming is given. The second part introduces the main concepts of ILP and systematically develops the most important results on model inference, inverse resolution, unfolding, refinement operators, least generalizations, and ways to deal with background knowledge. Furthermore, the authors give an overview of PAC learning results in ILP and of some of the most relevant implemented systems. },

  Abstract                 = {<p>Many real world applications depend on modeling the temporal dynamics of streams of diverse events, many of which are rare. We introduce a novel model class, Conjoint Piecewise-Constant Conditional Intensity Models, and a learning algorithm that together yield a data-driven approach to parameter sharing with the aim of better modeling such event streams. We empirically demonstrate that our approach yields more accurate models of two real world data sets: search query logs and data center system logs.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {Although initially introduced and studied in the late 1960s and early 1970s, statistical methods of Markov source or hidden Markov modeling have become increasingly popular in the last several years. There are two strong reasons why this has occurred. First the models are very rich in mathematical structure and hence can form the theoretical basis for use in a wide range of applications. Sec-ond the models, when applied properly, work very well in practice for several important applications. In this paper we attempt to care-fully and methodically review the theoretical aspects of this type of statistical modeling and show how they have been applied to selected problems in machine recognition of speech.

It's like active set search but with extra constraints (attributes from different tables are independent unless conditioned on links) More precise version: we have a context-dependent hierarchy inclusion property: If w(A)|C = 0 and A \subset B, C \subset D, then w(B)|D = 0 We do a full search over possible contexts, rather than an active set search. For a given context, we apply the inclusion property. We could also have an inclusion property within a given context. That would facilitate a hierarchy search both within and across contexts.}

  Abstract                 = {Bayes nets (BNs) for relational databases are a major research topic in machine learning and artificial intelligence. When cyclic dependencies exist, measuring the fit of a BN model to relational data with a likelihood function is a challenge \cite{Domingos2007,Taskar2002,bib:jensen-chapter,Getoor2007c}. A common approach to difficulties in defining a likelihood function is to employ a pseudo-likelihood; a prominent example is the pseudo likelihood defined for Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). This paper proposes a new pseudo likelihood $P^{\pseudo}$ for Parametrized Bayes Nets (PBNs) \cite{Poole2003}. The pseudo log-likelihood $L^{\pseudo} = ln(P^{\pseudo})$ is similar to the single-table BN log-likelihood, where row counts in the data table are replaced by frequencies in the database. We introduce a new type of semantics based on the concept of random instantiations (groundings) from classic AI research \cite{Halpern90,Bacchus90}: The measure $L^{\pseudo}$ is the expected log-likelihood of a random instantiation of the 1st-order variables in the PBN. The standard moralization method for converting a PBN to an MLN provides another interpretation of $L^{\pseudo}$: the measure is closely related to the log-likelihood and to the pseudo log-likelihood of the moralized PBN. For parameter learning, the $L^{\pseudo}$-maximizing estimates are the empirical conditional frequencies in the databases. For structure learning, we show that the state of the art learn-and-join method of Khosravi {\em et al.} \cite{Khosravi2010} implicitly maximizes the $L^{\pseudo}$ measure. The measure provides a theoretical foundation for this algorithm, while the algorithm's empirical success provides experimental validation for its usefulness.},

  Abstract                 = {Relational data classification is the problem of predicting a class label of a target entity given information about features of the entity, of the related entities, or neighbors, and of the links. This paper compares two fundamental approaches to relational classification: aggregating the features of entities related to a target instance, or aggregating the probabilistic predictions based on the features of each entity related to the target instance. Our experiments compare different relational classifiers on sports, financial, and movie data. We examine the strengths and weaknesses of both score and feature aggregation, both conceptually and empirically. The performance of a single aggregate operator (e.g., average) can vary widely across datasets, for both feature and score aggregation. Aggregate features can be adapted to a dataset by learning with a set of aggregate features. Used adaptively, aggregate features outperformed learning with a single fixed score aggregation operator. Since score aggregation is usually applied with a single fixed operator, this finding raises the challenge of adapting score aggregation to specific datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {Evaluating the overall ability of players in the National Hockey League (NHL) is a difficult task. Existing methods such as the famous ¡°plus/minus¡± statistic have many shortcomings. Standard linear regression methods work well when player substitutions are relatively uncommon and scoring events are relatively common, such as in basketball, but as neither of these conditions exists for hockey, we use an approach that embraces the unique characteristics of the sport. We model the scoring rate for each team as its own semi-Markov process, with hazard functions for each process that depend on the players on the ice. This method yields offensive and defensive player ability ratings which take into account quality of teammates and opponents, the game situation, and other desired factors, that themselves have a meaningful interpretation in terms of game outcomes. Additionally, since the number of parameters in this model can be quite large, we make use of two different shrinkage methods depending on the question of interest: full Bayesian hierarchical models that partially pool parameters according to player position, and penalized maximum likelihood estimation to select a smaller number of parameters that stand out as being substantially different from average. We apply the model to all five-on-five (full-strength) situations for games in five NHL seasons.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we develop a classical approach to model selection. Using the Kullback-Leibler Information Criterion to measure the closeness of a model to the truth, we propose simple likelihood-ratio based statistics for testing the null hypothesis that the competing models are equally close to the true data generating process against the alternative hypothesis that one model is closer. The tests are directional and are derived successively for the cases where the competing models are non-nested, overlapping, or nested and whether both, one, or neither is misspecified. As a prerequisite, we fully characterize the asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic under the most general conditions. We show that it is a weighted sum of chi-square distribution or a normal distribution depending on whether the distributions in the competing models closest to the truth are observationally identical. We also propose a test of this latter condition.},
