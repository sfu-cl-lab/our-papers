	first, deterministic dependencies are identified in the data; second,
	these dependencies are suitably minimalized in order to eliminate
	redundancies; and third, one or{\textemdash}in case of ambiguities{\textemdash}more
	than one causal structure is assigned to the minimalized deterministic
	dependencies.},

	linear causal structure from time series data have been developed
	using multiple conditional independence tests, but no such procedures
	are available for non-linear systems. We describe a feasible procedure
	for learning a class of non-linear time series structures, which
	we call additive non-linear time series. We show that for data generated
	from stationary models of this type, two classes of conditional independence
	relations among time series variables and their lags can be tested
	efficiently and consistently using tests based on additive model
	regression. Combining results of statistical tests for these two
	classes of conditional independence relations and the temporal structure
	of time series data, a new consistent model specification procedure
	is able to extract relatively detailed causal information. We investigate
	the finite sample behavior of the procedure through simulation, and
	illustrate the application of this method through analysis of the
	possible causal connections among four ocean indices. Several variants
	of the procedure are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Logical {B}ayesian Networks {(LBNs)} have recently been introduced
	as another language for knowledge based model construction of {B}ayesian
	networks, besides existing languages such as Probabilistic Relational
	Models {(PRMs)} and {B}ayesian Logic Programs {(BLPs).} The original
	description of {LBNs} introduces them as a variant of {BLPs} and
	discusses the differences with {BLPs} but still leaves room for a
	deeper discussion of the relationship between {LBNs} and {BLPs.}
	Also the relationship to {PRMs} was not treated in much detail. In
	this paper, we first give a more compact and clear definition of
	{LBNs.} Next, we describe in more detail how {PRMs} and {BLPs} relate
	to {LBNs.} Like this we not only see what the advantages and disadvantages
	of {LBNs} are with respect to {PRMs} and {BLPs,} we also gain more
	insight into the relationships between {PRMs} and {BLPs.} Keywords:
	Probabilistic-logical models, {B}ayesian networks, knowledge representation,
	{B}ayesian Logic Programs, Probabilistic Relational Models.},

  abstract = {In real world applications, graphical statistical models are not only
	a tool for operations such as classification or prediction, but usually
	the network structures of the models themselves are also of great
	interest (e.g., in modeling brain connectivity). The false discovery
	rate {(FDR),} the expected ratio of falsely claimed connections to
	all those claimed, is often a reasonable error-rate criterion in
	these applications. However, current learning algorithms for graphical
	models have not been adequately adapted to the concerns of the {FDR.}
	The traditional practice of controlling the type I error rate and
	the type {II} error rate under a conventional level does not necessarily
	keep the {FDR} low, especially in the case of sparse networks. In
	this paper, we propose embedding an {FDR-control} procedure into
	the {PC} algorithm to curb the {FDR} of the skeleton of the learned
	graph. We prove that the proposed method can control the {FDR} under
	a user-specified level at the limit of large sample sizes. In the
	cases of moderate sample size (about several hundred), empirical
	experiments show that the method is still able to control the {FDR}
	under the user-specified level, and a heuristic modification of the
	method is able to control the {FDR} more accurately around the user-specified
	level. The proposed method is applicable to any models for which
	statistical tests of conditional independence are available, such
	as discrete models and Gaussian models.},

	machine learning and logic programming. This self-contained tutorial
	is the first theoretical introduction to ILP; it provides the reader
	with a rigorous and sufficiently broad basis for future research
	in the area. In the first part, a thorough treatment of first-order
	logic, resolution-based theorem proving, and logic programming is
	given. The second part introduces the main concepts of ILP and systematically
	develops the most important results on model inference, inverse resolution,
	unfolding, refinement operators, least generalizations, and ways
	to deal with background knowledge. Furthermore, the authors give
	an overview of PAC learning results in ILP and of some of the most
	relevant implemented systems. },

	1970s, statistical methods of Markov source or hidden Markov modeling
	have become increasingly popular in the last several years. There
	are two strong reasons why this has occurred. First the models are
	very rich in mathematical structure and hence can form the theoretical
	basis for use in a wide range of applications. Sec-ond the models,
	when applied properly, work very well in practice for several important
	applications. In this paper we attempt to care-fully and methodically
	review the theoretical aspects of this type of statistical modeling
	and show how they have been applied to selected problems in machine
	recognition of speech. I.},

  abstract = {Bayes nets (BNs) for relational databases are a major research topic
	in machine learning and artificial intelligence. When cyclic dependencies
	exist, measuring the fit of a BN model to relational data with a
	likelihood function is a challenge \cite{Domingos2007,Taskar2002,bib:jensen-chapter,Getoor2007c}.
	A common approach to difficulties in defining a likelihood function
	is to employ a pseudo-likelihood; a prominent example is the pseudo
	likelihood defined for Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). This paper proposes
	a new pseudo likelihood $P^{\pseudo}$ for Parametrized Bayes Nets
	(PBNs) \cite{Poole2003}. The pseudo log-likelihood $L^{\pseudo} =
	ln(P^{\pseudo})$ is similar to the single-table BN log-likelihood,
	where row counts in the data table are replaced by frequencies in
	the database. We introduce a new type of semantics based on the concept
	of random instantiations (groundings) from classic AI research \cite{Halpern90,Bacchus90}:
	The measure $L^{\pseudo}$ is the expected log-likelihood of a random
	instantiation of the 1st-order variables in the PBN. The standard
	moralization method for converting a PBN to an MLN provides another
	interpretation of $L^{\pseudo}$: the measure is closely related to
	the log-likelihood and to the pseudo log-likelihood of the moralized
	PBN. For parameter learning, the $L^{\pseudo}$-maximizing estimates
	are the empirical conditional frequencies in the databases. For structure
	learning, we show that the state of the art learn-and-join method
	of Khosravi {\em et al.} \cite{Khosravi2010} implicitly maximizes
	the $L^{\pseudo}$ measure. The measure provides a theoretical foundation
	for this algorithm, while the algorithm's empirical success provides
	experimental validation for its usefulness.},
