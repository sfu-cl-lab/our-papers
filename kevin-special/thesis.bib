                  growing field combining machine learning and logic
                  programming. This self-contained tutorial is the
                  first theoretical introduction to ILP; it provides
                  the reader with a rigorous and sufficiently broad
                  basis for future research in the area. In the first
                  part, a thorough treatment of first-order logic,
                  resolution-based theorem proving, and logic
                  programming is given. The second part introduces the
                  main concepts of ILP and systematically develops the
                  most important results on model inference, inverse
                  resolution, unfolding, refinement operators, least
                  generalizations, and ways to deal with background
                  knowledge. Furthermore, the authors give an overview
                  of PAC learning results in ILP and of some of the
                  most relevant implemented systems. },
