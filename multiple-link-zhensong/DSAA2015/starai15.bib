Following an introduction to the system and its query language SiQL, we present application scenarios from the areas of gene expression/regulation and small molecules. Next, we describe a web service interface to Sindbad that enables new possibilities for inductive databases (distributing tasks over multiple servers, language and platform independence, …). Finally, we discuss future plans for the system, in particular, to make the system more ‘declarative’ by the use of signatures, to integrate the useful concept of mining views into the system, and to support specific pattern domains like graphs and strings.},
