 Hi Oliver,

Since I did not receive your email to indicate that you have finished the registration.
So I did the registration for you.  And I will forward the confirmation letter to you once I got it.

If you already did this yourself, just let me know and I will apply for a refund before September 8th.
The reimbursement will be processed after the conference. 

Best,
Zhensong

Hi Oliver,

The early registration fee as ILP regular is 450 dollars.  

Let's say if you did *NOT* reply my email before next Monday (July 14th), I will do it for you in case we have to pay more 100 bucks.

p.s. Cathy and Yan just asked if they could put the paper on their CV, so when do you think we could update the co-author list? and the order?
p.p.s. It's unbelievable that Germany won the semi-final with 7:1.
