	trees: you search for local subfamilies, then you look more closely
	at clauses. They search for literals though, we search for functor
	nodes.
	
	
	they cheat on their experiments: for each query, they relearn the
	weights to optimize for the query variable in question
	
	
	they note that producing rules that are way too short is typical for
	MLN learning because of the need to computationally constrain the
	search space.}
