ml: orient deterministic schema edges differently.
unielwn: the same
muta: outlier for laj+. Actually, what may be going on is that we have correlations among attributes conditional on relationships being false. In LAJ, we can represent that only using the relationship indicator as a common parent.
hepa: very long run-time for flat search. Because the schema is too complicated.
