Details
==========

trfiles: the filenames of the 4356 training images.

tsfiles: the filenames of the 4305 test images.

scene_names: the names of the 1027 scene classes.

labeltr: the labeling matrix (4356x1027) of the training images. labeltr_{ij} = 1 indicates that the i-th training images belongs to the j-th scene class; labeltr_{ij} = 0 otherwise.

labelts: the labeling matrix (4305x1027) of the test images. labelts_{ij} = 1 indicates that the i-th test images belongs to the j-th scene class; labelts_{ij} = 0 otherwise.

clstr: the indices of the 58 scene classes we have used in our erxperiments.
