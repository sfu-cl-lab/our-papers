\f0\fs36 \cf0 \\title\{Computing Relational Sufficient Statistics for \'a0Large Databases\}\
\
Fast access to sufficient statistics (event counts) is a key factor for scalable data mining and machine learning. We present an efficient dynamic programming algorithm for computing relational sufficient statistics that combine information from different database tables.  They represent instantiation counts for conjunctive queries that specify the values of attributes, the presence of any number of relationships, and the absence of any number of relationships. The statistics are stored in contingency tables. We introduce contingency table algebra, an extension of relational algebra, to compactly describe and efficiently implement the dynamic program. An empirical evaluation on seven benchmark databases demonstrates the scalability of our algorithm. As an application, we show how the precomputed sufficient statistics support learning a Bayes net model for the entire input database. The scalability of Bayes net structure learning depends mainly on fast access to sufficient statistics; our algorithm is the first to accomplish structure learning for databases with over 1 million records.}
