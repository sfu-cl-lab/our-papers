----- TEXT:
This paper presents a model (VHER) to predict which player is acting given a game situation and predict the players expected goals in a game. The model is tested using a dataset of game events and player actions from SportLogiq. It is able to achieve good results in comparison to the other baseline methods tested, the inclusion of the box-scores into the model has a significant impact on the results. It would be interesting to see the accuracies in Table 3 for the expected goals as well. 

I like the use of figures 1, 2 and 3 to show how the model works. To improve, it would be good to see some further discussion about the model and its applications for teams or companies in the real-world. 

[discuss improving on XGoals. could be  used for player ranking. Win probabilities. ] 

Overall, I found this an enjoyable paper that could have a number of applications in real-time analytics systems and could help to aid the identification of players in computer vision systems. It would be interesting to see how the model performs across other sports such as football and basketball. [mention this too] 
I think it would be a good addition to the workshop.

This is a great paper that is perfect for this workshop. The introduction clearly sets up the need for a latent representation of players. The methodology is well written and motivated. The experiments clearly show the added value of VHER over the baselines.

I do have one remark related to the player re-indentification task. Given how much better the models with play history (LSTM, VHER) perform compared to the models that do not consider play history (DE and CVAE), is it possible that there is some information leakage going on here? What I am thinking is that an ice-hockey team only plays with 5-6 players. LSTM and VHER have access to the play history and thus also to the IDs of the players that performed actions within a specific game. This means that while DE and CVAE are trying to re-identify a player out of 1003 possible players, LSTM and VHER only need to re-identify a player out of 5 or 6 possible players as they know which players are currently playing in the game. Have you thought about this? And if this is true, do you think the experiments in the paper about re-identification are still fair?

[we can also acknowledge. Experiment would be more fair with a softmax over possible players on the rink.]
